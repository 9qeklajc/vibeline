  User request:
  {transcript}

  Please analyze the transcript and extract all decisions made. For each decision, identify:
  1. The decision itself
  2. Who made the decision (if clear)
  3. When it was made (if clear)
  4. Any context or reasoning behind the decision
  5. Any conditions or dependencies

  Rules:
  - Output should be in valid JSON format
  - Each decision should be a separate object in an array
  - Include all relevant details for each decision
  - Be specific and clear in the decision descriptions
  - If certain information is not available, use null for that field

  Format the output as:
  {
    "decisions": [
      {
        "decision": "string",
        "made_by": "string or null",
        "timestamp": "string or null",
        "context": "string or null",
        "conditions": "string or null"
      }
    ]
  }
